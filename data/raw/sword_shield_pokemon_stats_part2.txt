After battle, this Pokémon carefully sharpens its tusks on river rocks. It needs to take care of its tusks—if one breaks, it will never grow back.
Its skin is as hard as a suit of armor. Fraxure’s favorite strategy is to tackle its opponents, stabbing them with its tusks at the same time.

Its resilient tusks are its pride and joy. It licks up dirt to take in the minerals it needs to keep its tusks in top condition.
While usually kindhearted, it can be terrifying if angered. Tusks that can slice through steel beams are how Haxorus deals with its adversaries.

When attacked, it tightly shuts the lid of its shell. This reaction fails to protect it from Karrablast, however, because they can still get into the shell.
It has a strange physiology that responds to electricity. When together with Karrablast, Shelmet evolves for some reason.

It chooses a Pangoro as its master and then imitates its master’s actions. This is how it learns to battle and hunt for prey.
Wanting to make sure it’s taken seriously, Pancham’s always giving others a glare. But if it’s not focusing, it ends up smiling.

Though Espurr’s expression never changes, behind that blank stare is an intense struggle to contain its devastating psychic power.
There’s enough psychic power in Espurr to send a wrestler flying, but because this power can’t be controlled, Espurr finds it troublesome.

Revealing the eyelike patterns on the insides of its ears will unleash its psychic powers. It normally keeps the patterns hidden, however.
The defensive instinct of the males is strong. It’s when they’re protecting themselves or their partners that they unleash their full power.

Seven Binacle come together to form one Barbaracle. The Binacle that serves as the head gives orders to those serving as the limbs.
Having an eye on each palm allows it to keep watch in all directions. In a pinch, its limbs start to act on their own to ensure the enemy’s defeat.

A now-vanished desert culture treasured these Pokémon. Appropriately, when Heliolisk came to the Galar region, treasure came with them.
One Heliolisk basking in the sun with its frill outspread is all it would take to produce enough electricity to power a city.

At a distance, it launches its sharp feathers while flying about. If the enemy gets too close, Rowlet switches tactics and delivers vicious kicks.
During the day, it builds up energy via photosynthesis. At night, it flies silently through the sky, on the prowl for prey.

It throws one knifelike feather after another at its enemies, and each one precisely strikes a weak point. These feathers are known as blade quills.
It never slacks when it comes to the task of cleaning its feathers. Thorough preening keeps it looking spiffy and its blade quills nice and sharp.

As if wielding a bow, it launches the arrow quills hidden among the feathers of its wings. Decidueye’s shots never miss.
In a tenth of a second, it can nock and fire an arrow quill, piercing an opponent’s weak point before they notice what’s happening.

It spends even the smallest amount of downtime grooming its fur with its tongue. Loose fur gathers in its stomach and serves as fuel for fiery moves.
Trying to pet Litten before it trusts you will result in a nasty scratch from its sharp claws. Be careful.

It excels at violent, no-holds-barred battles. The temperature of the flames that issue from its navel exceeds 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit.
Incineroar’s rough and aggressive behavior is its most notable trait, but the way it helps out small Pokémon shows that it has a kind side as well.

It creates special bouncy balloons to send at its opponents. When the balloons pop, the sheer force of their bursting is what deals damage.
If Popplio want to create big, powerful balloons, they must be persistent. It takes daily practice for these Pokémon to develop their skills.

Nectar and pollen are its favorite fare. You can find Cutiefly hovering around Gossifleur, trying to get some of Gossifleur’s pollen.
An opponent’s aura can tell Cutiefly what that opponent’s next move will be. Then Cutiefly can glide around the attack and strike back.

To survive in the cold waters of Galar, this Pokémon forms a dome with its legs, enclosing its body so it can capture its own body heat.
Within the poison sac in its body is a poison so toxic that Pokémon as large as Wailord will still be suffering three days after it first takes effect.

If it sees any movement around it, this Pokémon charges for it straightaway, leading with its sharply pointed jaw. It’s very proud of that jaw.
After it’s eaten its fill, its movements become extremely sluggish. That’s when Cramorant swallows it up.

This Pokémon has a jaw that’s as sharp as a spear and as strong as steel. Apparently Barraskewda’s flesh is surprisingly tasty, too.
It spins its tail fins to propel itself, surging forward at speeds of over 100 knots before ramming prey and spearing into them.

It stores flammable gas in its body and uses it to generate heat. The yellow sections on its belly get particularly hot.
It wraps prey up with its heated body, cooking them in its coils. Once they’re well-done, it will voraciously nibble them down to the last morsel.

Evolves into Grapploct-0 @ 0 (LevelUpKnowMove) [269]

It’s very curious, but its means of investigating things is to try to punch them with its tentacles. The search for food is what brings it onto land.
Its tentacles tear off easily, but it isn’t alarmed when that happens—it knows they’ll grow back. It’s about as smart as a three-year-old.

Searching for an opponent to test its skills against, it emerges onto land. Once the battle is over, it returns to the sea.

It digs up the ground with its trunk. It’s also very strong, being able to carry loads of over five tons without any problem at all.
If a job requires serious strength, this Pokémon will excel at it. Its copper body tarnishes in the rain, turning a vibrant green color.

In ancient times, it was unbeatable thanks to its powerful lower body, but it went extinct anyway after it depleted all its plant-based food sources.
The powerful muscles in its tail generate its electricity. Compared to its lower body, its upper half is entirely too small.

The shaking of its freezing upper half is what generates its electricity. It has a hard time walking around.
This Pokémon lived on prehistoric seashores and was able to preserve food with the ice on its body. It went extinct because it moved so slowly.

The special metal that composes its body is very light, so this Pokémon has considerable agility. It lives in caves because it dislikes the rain.

When it isn’t battling, it keeps Dreepy in the holes on its horns. Once a fight starts, it launches the Dreepy like supersonic missiles.
Apparently the Dreepy inside Dragapult’s horns eagerly look forward to being launched out at Mach speeds.

In times past, it worked together with a king of the people to save the Galar region. It absorbs metal that it then uses in battle.

The core on its chest absorbs energy emanating from the lands of the Galar region. This energy is what allows Eternatus to stay active.
It was inside a meteorite that fell 20,000 years ago. There seems to be a connection between this Pokémon and the Dynamax phenomenon.
