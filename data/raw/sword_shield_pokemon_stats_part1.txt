It can be found near the sea. The large pincers grow back if they are torn out of their sockets.

As a bud, it barely moves. It sits still, placidly waiting for sunlight to appear.
Its folded petals are pretty tough. Bird Pok√©mon can peck at them all they want, and Cherrim won‚Äôt be bothered at all.

This Pok√©mon‚Äôs habitat shapes its physique. According to some theories, life in warm ocean waters causes this variation to develop.
Subjecting this Pok√©mon to a strong force causes it to secrete a strange purple fluid. Though harmless, the fluid is awfully sticky.

Its search for food sometimes leads it onto land, where it leaves behind a sticky trail of slime as it passes through.
The softness of its body helps disperse the force of impacts, so although its body is uncommonly squishy, it‚Äôs also surprisingly resilient.

It digs holes in the ground to make its nest. The stench of the fluid it lets fly from the tip of its tail is extremely potent.

It‚Äôs so vicious that it‚Äôs called the Sand Demon. Yet when confronted by Hippowdon, Drapion keeps a low profile and will never pick a fight.

It steals things from people just to amuse itself with their frustration. A rivalry exists between this Pok√©mon and Nickit.
Opponents that get drawn in by its adorable behavior come away with stinging scratches from its claws and stinging pride from its laughter.

It eats dreams and releases mist. The mist is pink when it‚Äôs eating a good dream, and black when it‚Äôs eating a nightmare.

When dark mists emanate from its body, don‚Äôt get too near. If you do, your nightmares will become reality.
It drowses and dreams all the time. It‚Äôs best to leave it be if it‚Äôs just woken up, as it‚Äôs a terrible grump when freshly roused from sleep.

It‚Äôs as hard as steel, but apparently a long soak in water will cause it to soften a bit.
When it detects a noise, it starts to move. The energy core inside it makes this Pok√©mon slightly warm to the touch.

If you see its orange crystals start to glow, be wary. It‚Äôs about to fire off bursts of energy.
It relies on sound in order to monitor what‚Äôs in its vicinity. When angered, it will attack without ever changing the direction it‚Äôs facing.
